# GROUP-5-Gesture-Controlled-Robotic-Arm-
Gesture-Controlled Robotic ArmProject Overview:This project involves designing and simulating a gesture-controlled robotic arm using Proteus for circuit simulation and Arduino for microcontroller programming. The robotic arm is controlled using hand gestures detected by a potentiometer, which sends signals to an Arduino to move the arm accordingly.
